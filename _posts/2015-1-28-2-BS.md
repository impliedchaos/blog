title: Stupid Javascript - Electronic Battleship&reg; Probabilities.
---

So my son lost to the computer in Hasbro's Electronic Talking Battleship&reg; game, and I decided that he shouldn't do that again.  So I compiled all 100 possible formations, and created a [handy webpage]({{ site.url}}/bs.html) to figure out what the computer (or lazy human opponent) is using.

![whee]({{ site.url }}/img/bs.png)

My son thinks I'm a cheater.  Whatever, always call H7.
