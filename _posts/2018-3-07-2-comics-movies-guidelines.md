title: Guidelines for Inclusion of Comics Based Movies
---

## Dave's (Arbitrary) Movie Selection Guidelines
1. All movies must have main characters or a plot based on a Comic Strip, Comic Book, or Graphic Novel.
   1. Superhero does not equal Comic Book.  There are plenty of non-superhero comics, and plenty of non-comic-based superhero movies.
   1. Lots of franchises exist in comics but did not originate that way.  _The Shadow_ and _Green Hornet_ are not comics-based, while _Little Orphan Anne_, _Flash Gordon_, and _Prince Valiant_ are.
   1. _Transformers_, _GI-Joe_, and _He-Man_ (for example) originated as toys, not comics.  If a movie was made specifically from the plot of a comics series, then it would count.
   1. Alien Xenomorphs and The Predator are original film characters.  However, the _AVP_ movie was based on a comic book, so this counts.  Same with the literary characters from _LXG_ and the mythological character of _Marvel's Thor_.
1. All movies must be theatrical length and live-action or CGI animated.
   1. No TV Shows.  This includes the Netflix MCU shows.
   1. Direct-to-Video (or streaming) is fine, but  Made-for-TV-Movies are not.
   1. No cartoons.   These are full of specialty voice-actors that would crowd out the list.
   1. CGI Animated films are generally OK, but if they've got nothing but specialty voice actors, they are out.  The first two _Garfield_ movies are OK, the next three are not.
1. All movies must be English language, or at least partially English language.
   1. No real good reason for this, except me being lazy and not wanting to have to search for every foreign comics-based movie.
   1. Sadly lots of interesting stuff gets left out because of this rule. :(
   1. Some partially English inclusions in the current list are : _Immortals_, _Largo Winch_, and _Gemma Bovery_.
1. Movies don't have to be released yet, but they must be at least in production.  No pre-production or "maybe someday" development-hell movies.
1. Nothing before 1950. Just because I'm lazy.

## Actor and Character Guidelines
1. In general roles as an extra don't count.
   1. Usually roles without a character name don't count.
   1. However, some can.  For example, Peter Mensah's "Messenger" role in _300_ was pretty important, and would definitely count.  Michael Jai White's "Audience Man" in _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II_ wouldn't.
1. Actors only.  Stan Lee and Frank Miller cameos don't count.
