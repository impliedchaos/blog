title: Guidelines for inclusion of Comics Based Movies
---

## Dave's (Arbitrary) Movie Selection Guidelines
1. All movies must have main characters or a plot based on a Comic Strip, Comic Book, or Graphic Novel.
  1. Superhero does not equal Comic Book.  There are plenty of non-superhero comics, and plenty of non-comic-based superhero movies.
  1. Lots of franchises exist in comics but did not originate that way.  The Shadow and Green Hornet are not comics-based, while Little Orphan Anne, Flash Gordon, and Prince Valiant are.
  1. Transformers, GI-Joe, and He-Man (for example) originated as toys, not comics.  If a movie was made specifically from the plot of a comics series, then it would count.
  1. Alien Xenomorphs and The Predator are original film characters.  However, the AVP movie was based on a comic book, so this counts.  Same with the literary characters from LXG and the mythological character of Marvel's Thor.
1. All movies must be theatrical length and live-action or CGI animated.
  1. No TV Shows.  This includes the Netflix MCU shows.
  1. Direct-to-Video (or streaming) is fine, but  Made-for-TV-Movies are not.
  1. No cartoons.   These are full of specialty voice-actors that would crowd out the list.
  1. CGI Animated films are generally OK, but if they've got nothing but specialty voice actors, they are out.  The first two Garfield movies are OK, the next three are not.
1. All movies must be English language, or at least partially English language.
  1. No real good reason for this, except me being lazy and not wanting to have to search for every foreign comics-based movie.
  1. Sadly lots of interesting stuff gets left out because of this rule. :(
  1. Some partially English inclusions in the current list are : Immortals, Largo Winch, Gemma Bovery.
1. Movies don't have to be released yet, but they must be at least in production.  No pre-production or "maybe someday" development-hell movies.
